# validated-memory

A Claude Code plugin that packages a validated-memory method for agent projects
as a portable component: skills that make the convention invocable, a single CLI
with the enforcement modules (agent-memory lint, contract validator, index
deriver, freshness probes with a ternary verdict), and a bootstrap scaffold.

Adopter projects keep only Markdown data and configuration; all code lives in
the plugin, so fixes reach every adopter on update. The data stays readable
without the plugin installed.

## Status

Under construction (v1). The CLI currently exposes stub subcommands.

## Layers

- **Agent memory** — one Markdown file per fact plus a one-line-per-entry index,
  versioned inside the adopter repo. Supersession is exercised by rewriting the
  entry's `description`; `lint` enforces the convention.
- **Curated knowledge** — Markdown units with a base contract: identity,
  evidence state (`measured | verifiable | hypothesis`), supersession without
  deletion (`supersedes`, many-to-one), optional anchors separated from
  provenance. `validate` enforces the contract plus the adopter's declared
  extension; `derive` re-derives indexes; `probe` runs freshness probes and
  records ternary verdicts (`current | drifted | unknown`, fail-explicit).

## CLI

```
python3 -m validated_memory <command>
```

Commands: `init`, `lint`, `validate`, `derive`, `probe`.

Exit codes: `0` = clean run or WARNING-only findings (does not gate);
non-zero = ERROR (gates).

## Development

Runtime code is Python 3, standard library only. pytest is the only
development dependency.

```
python3 -m pytest
```

Tests are end-to-end only: they invoke the CLI as a subprocess over fixture
adopter trees and assert on exit codes, output, and produced files. Tests never
import the package's internals.
