# validated-memory

A Claude Code plugin that packages a validated-memory method for agent projects
as a portable component: skills that make the convention invocable, a single CLI
with the enforcement modules (agent-memory lint, contract validator, index
deriver, freshness probes with a ternary verdict), and a bootstrap scaffold.

Adopter projects keep only Markdown data and configuration; all code lives in
the plugin, so fixes reach every adopter on update. The data stays readable
without the plugin installed.

## Status

v1 complete. Every subcommand is live: `validate` enforces the base contract
and the adopter's declared extension; `lint` enforces the agent-memory
layer; `derive` re-derives the knowledge index, with a `--check` gate, and
reads real freshness verdicts; `probe` runs freshness probes and records
them, including the bundled `git_ref` probe; `init` scaffolds a new adopter
project. Five skills make the method invocable from the CLI surface alone,
and a `SessionStart` hook keeps a `--harness-memory` symlink alive across
sessions -- see "Skills" and "Startup hook" below.

## Layers

- **Agent memory** — one Markdown file per fact plus a one-line-per-entry index,
  versioned inside the adopter repo. Supersession is exercised by rewriting the
  entry's `description`; `lint` enforces the convention.
- **Curated knowledge** — Markdown units with a base contract: identity,
  evidence state (`measured | verifiable | hypothesis`), supersession without
  deletion (`supersedes`, many-to-one), optional anchors separated from
  provenance. `validate` enforces the contract plus the adopter's declared
  extension; `derive` re-derives indexes; `probe` runs freshness probes and
  records ternary verdicts (`current | drifted | unknown`, fail-explicit).

## CLI

```
python3 -m validated_memory <command>
```

Commands: `init`, `lint`, `validate`, `derive`, `probe`.

Exit codes: `0` = clean run or WARNING-only findings (does not gate);
non-zero = ERROR (gates).

### `init`

```
python3 -m validated_memory init [--harness-memory PATH]
```

Scaffolds a new adopter project in the working directory: `knowledge/`
(empty), `memory/` with an empty index (`memory/MEMORY.md`), the adopter
configuration (`validated-memory.md`), and a valid, empty declared-extension
stub (`knowledge-extension.md`). Right after `init` on an empty directory,
`validate` and `lint` both pass clean -- the bootstrap is verified by the
enforcement it bootstraps, not by inspection. (An empty `knowledge/`
directory still reports its usual WARNING for having no units; that does not
gate.)

Each item is created only if missing. An existing item -- including one
already hand-edited -- is never touched: `init` reports `init: created
<path>` or `init: kept <path>` per item, so re-running it is idempotent and
says so. The only way `init` gates (exit 1) is an item it could not create at
all, e.g. no write permission on the target directory.

`validated-memory.md` declares the full adopter surface `extension.py`
validates: the declared extension (`schema`, `version`), the `id_prefix`,
and the probe registry, already mapping `git_ref` to its bundled probe
command (`python3 -m validated_memory.probes.git_ref`; see "The bundled
`git_ref` probe" under `probe` below) -- see "Adopter configuration"
below. `knowledge-extension.md` declares no fields (`fields: []`, a valid,
empty extension) and its body documents, in prose, the field format (`name`,
`type`, `values`; types `string` and `enum`) and the versioning rule.
Both files are plain Markdown with a YAML-subset frontmatter: readable
without the plugin installed.

**`--harness-memory PATH`** makes PATH a move-proof symlink to this
project's `memory/` directory (absolute target), so the harness can read
agent memory from wherever it expects it while the data stays versioned
inside the adopter repo:

- PATH missing: `init` creates the symlink (making parent directories as
  needed).
- PATH already a symlink -- pointing at this project, elsewhere, or broken:
  `init` re-points it at this project's `memory/`. Re-pointing a symlink
  never destroys data, so restoring it after the adopter project is renamed
  or re-cloned is exactly re-running `init --harness-memory PATH` from the
  new location: the link moves, the memory files underneath are untouched.
  Already pointing at the right place is a no-op (`kept`).
- PATH already exists as a real directory holding the harness's own agent
  memory: `init` absorbs it -- see "Absorbing an existing harness memory
  directory" below.
- PATH already exists as anything else real (a file, or a directory that is
  not agent memory): fail-open. `init` reports a WARNING naming what it found
  and why the directory did not qualify, and leaves PATH exactly as it was --
  exit 0, nothing deleted, nothing moved.

Computing PATH from the harness's own layout and calling `init
--harness-memory PATH` automatically on every session start is the plugin's
startup hook (`hooks/restore-memory-symlink.sh`, wired as `SessionStart` in
`hooks/hooks.json` -- see "Startup hook" below), and is **not** part of
`init` itself. `init` only guarantees the hook can call it repeatedly, from
any project state, without ever losing data.

#### Absorbing an existing harness memory directory

A project that adopts this plugin after the harness has already been writing
agent memory of its own finds PATH occupied by a real directory full of
memory files. Leaving it alone would leave two live memories that cannot see
each other: the harness reads its own directory, the plugin reads the
project's `memory/`, and neither shows the other's facts. So `init` absorbs
it, in this order -- nothing is parked until the copy is done:

1. **Recognize.** PATH qualifies only if every file under it is a `.md` file
   and every one of them except a top-level `MEMORY.md` carries the
   agent-memory frontmatter `lint` requires (see "Agent memory" below). A
   top-level `MEMORY.md` alone is recognition enough. Anything else -- a
   stray non-Markdown file, a `.md` without that frontmatter -- disqualifies
   the whole directory, which is then left untouched with a WARNING naming
   the file that disqualified it. Hidden files count: a stray `.gitkeep` or
   `.DS_Store` blocks the merge until someone removes it. The bias is
   deliberate: a false negative costs a warning, a false positive moves a
   directory that belongs to something else.
2. **Copy in.** Every memory file is copied into the project's `memory/`,
   preserving subdirectories, **only where the destination does not exist**.
   A destination that already holds identical content is skipped silently, so
   re-running is quiet. A destination that differs is a real conflict: the
   project's copy is kept, and a WARNING says so -- the harness's version is
   still in the backup from step 4, for a human to reconcile.
3. **Reconcile the index.** Every adopted file gets an entry in the project's
   `memory/MEMORY.md`: the line the harness's own index carried for it when
   there was one, synthesized from the file's `name` and `description`
   otherwise. Reconciling only ever appends -- entries already in the
   project's index are never rewritten or removed -- except for the `No
   entries yet.` placeholder `init` writes into a fresh index, which goes as
   soon as the index has real entries. The result passes `lint` clean, which
   is how the absorption is verified.
4. **Park.** The original directory is renamed alongside itself, to
   `<PATH>.bak` (or `.bak.1`, `.bak.2`, the first free slot -- an existing
   backup is never overwritten). Nothing is deleted: after the run there are
   two copies of every adopted file, one live inside the project and one in
   the backup.
5. **Link.** Only now is the symlink created, so the harness and the plugin
   read the same files from that point on.

The one exception to "nothing is deleted": PATH as an **empty** directory is
removed with `rmdir` and replaced by the symlink, with no backup. `rmdir` is
refused by the operating system on anything that is not empty, so it cannot
lose data, and the alternative -- an empty `.bak` on the side, or a WARNING
on every session start forever -- is worse.

Every failure along the way is fail-open: a WARNING, exit 0, and a state that
still holds every file. The order is what guarantees it -- a failed copy
leaves the original in place and unparked, a failed park leaves the copies in
the project and the original intact, and a failed link leaves the backup path
named in the WARNING.

### `lint`

```
python3 -m validated_memory lint [PATH]
```

Lints the agent-memory layer: every `*.md` file found under PATH, recursively,
except the index `MEMORY.md` itself. With no PATH it reads `memory/` relative
to the working directory. A one-line summary goes to stdout; findings go to
stderr in the same shape `validate` uses:

```
SEVERITY: <location>: <field>: <message>
SEVERITY: <location>:<line>: <field>: <message>    # parse errors only
```

`lint` resolves wikilinks and the supersession convention against the whole
memory set, so a missing `MEMORY.md`, a missing memory directory, or an
explicit PATH that does not exist each stop the run before any file is read.

### `validate`

```
python3 -m validated_memory validate [PATH]
```

Validates every `*.md` unit found under PATH, recursively; PATH may also be a
single unit file. With no PATH it reads `knowledge/` relative to the working
directory. A one-line summary goes to stdout; findings go to stderr as

```
SEVERITY: <unit>: <field>: <message>
SEVERITY: <unit>:<line>: <field>: <message>    # parse errors only
```

A contract rule speaks about the unit as a whole, so it reports no line. Only
the parser reports one, because only the parser knows where it stopped.

Supersession resolves against the validated set: validate the whole knowledge
directory, not a single file, or a `supersedes` entry pointing at a unit you
left out is reported as missing.

### `derive`

```
python3 -m validated_memory derive [PATH] [--check]
```

Re-derives the curated-knowledge index from the units under PATH, resolved
exactly like `validate`'s PATH (default `knowledge/`, single unit file or a
directory, same errors on a missing path). Deriving requires a valid source:
`derive` first runs the same validation as `validate` (base contract plus the
adopter's declared extension). An ERROR finding reports the findings to
stderr, in `validate`'s format, and stops -- nothing is written or checked.
A WARNING does not block.

The index is written to `knowledge-index.md` in the current working
directory, never inside `knowledge/`: anything ending in `.md` there is read
as a unit (see "Keep the schema outside the curated-knowledge directory"
above -- the same reason applies to the index).

```markdown
# Knowledge index

Derived: 2026-08-12T10:00:00Z
Basis: 2 unit(s) under knowledge/

| id | state | evidence | verdict |
|----|-------|----------|---------|
| kb-0001 | superseded by kb-0002 | measured | unknown |
| kb-0002 | active | hypothesis | unknown |
```

- `Derived:` is the UTC ISO-8601 timestamp of the derivation run.
- `Basis:` is the recount basis: how many units, under which path.
- Rows are sorted by `id`. Nothing is omitted: a superseded unit is still
  listed, marked, never mutated.
- **state** is computed, never stored on the unit: `active`, or
  `superseded by <ids>` naming every unit that lists this one in its own
  `supersedes` (many-to-one), sorted and comma-separated.
- **verdict** reads the service view of `verdicts.jsonl` (the log `probe`
  writes -- see the `probe` section below): for each of the unit's anchors,
  the latest verdict of its `(system, kind)`, or `unknown` when the anchor was
  never probed -- fail-explicit. A unit is graded by the worst of its
  anchors' verdicts (`drifted` > `unknown` > `current`):
  - no anchors: `unknown`, on its own.
  - the worst verdict is `unknown`: `unknown (<systems>)`, naming every
    system behind an `unknown` anchor, sorted and comma-separated -- this
    also covers a unit with anchors that was never probed at all.
  - the worst verdict is `drifted` and some anchors are also `unknown`:
    `drifted (unknown: <systems>)`.
  - otherwise: the verdict alone (`current` or `drifted`).

`--check` recalculates the index in memory instead of writing it, and
compares it against the `knowledge-index.md` already on disk, line by line.
The `Derived:` line must be there, but **its timestamp is ignored** -- it
changes on every run, so what has to match is the rest: `Basis:` and the
table. A missing index is an ERROR pointing at running `derive` first. Any
divergence -- `Basis:`, a row, a missing or extra line -- is an ERROR naming
the first line that does not match, numbered as on disk. `--check` never
writes. A match exits clean with a summary. This makes `derive --check` a
local or CI gate for adopters who version the derived index: hand-editing it,
or letting it drift from the units, fails the check. **The verdict column is
part of that content**: running `probe` between a `derive` and a
`derive --check` changes what the recalculated index says, so the check
correctly fails against the now-stale on-disk index -- run `derive` again to
pick up the new verdicts.

Exit codes: `0` clean, or WARNING-only validation findings; `1` an ERROR
finding (source validation, or a `--check` mismatch); `2` a usage error.

### `probe`

```
python3 -m validated_memory probe [PATH]
```

Runs freshness probes over the anchors of every *active* curated-knowledge
unit found under PATH, resolved exactly like `validate`'s PATH (default
`knowledge/`), and records what each probe answered. "Active" excludes a unit
that appears in another unit's `supersedes` within the validated set -- a
superseded unit is not current, so its anchors are never probed. Probing
requires a valid source: `probe` first runs the same validation as `validate`
and `derive` (base contract plus the adopter's declared extension); an ERROR
finding stops the run before anything is probed. A WARNING does not block.

**Probe contract.** A probe is registered per anchor `kind` in the `probes`
map of `validated-memory.md` (see "Adopter configuration" above). The
registered command is split with `shlex.split` and run **without a shell**.

- It receives the anchor's envelope on **stdin**, as JSON:
  ```json
  {"system": "repo-a", "kind": "git_ref", "captured_at": "2026-08-11T10:00:00Z", "payload": {}}
  ```
  The unit's id is deliberately not included -- the envelope is the
  producer/store boundary, and a probe only needs to know what it is
  checking, not which unit cites it.
- It answers on **stdout**, as JSON, and exits `0`:
  ```json
  {"verdict": "current", "detail": "optional free-form note"}
  ```
  `verdict` is one of `current | drifted | unknown`; `detail` is optional.

Any failure falls back to `unknown`, with a note explaining why, and never
aborts the run: no probe registered for the anchor's `kind` (or no
`validated-memory.md` at all), a command that cannot be run (parse failure,
executable not found), a non-zero exit, stdout that does not parse as JSON,
or a verdict outside the three-value domain. Each such fallback is reported
to stderr as a WARNING finding, in the usual shape:

```
WARNING: <unit>: anchors[<i>]: <message>
```

**The verdict log.** Every anchor probed -- successful or fallen back --
appends one JSON line to `verdicts.jsonl` in the current working directory,
never inside `knowledge/`, for the same reason `knowledge-index.md` lives
outside it (see "Keep the schema outside the curated-knowledge directory"
above). The log is **append-only**: a run never rewrites or removes a prior
line, so the full probing history accumulates. Each line:

```json
{"recorded_at": "2026-08-12T10:00:00Z", "unit": "kb-0001", "system": "repo-a", "kind": "git_ref", "verdict": "current", "detail": null}
```

The **service view** a reader wants -- and the one `derive` reads for its
verdict column -- is the latest record per `(unit, system, kind)`; re-probing
adds new lines, it never edits history.

A summary goes to stdout:

```
probe: 3 anchor(s) probed across 1 unit(s): 1 current, 1 drifted, 1 unknown
```

Exit codes: `0` clean, or WARNING-only findings -- **a `drifted` or
`unknown` verdict is data, not a finding, and never gates `probe`**; `1` an
ERROR (source validation, or the verdict log could not be written); `2` a
usage error.

#### The bundled `git_ref` probe

Ships with the plugin at `validated_memory/probes/git_ref.py`, invocable as
`python3 -m validated_memory.probes.git_ref` -- the command `init` already
registers for `git_ref` in the scaffolded `validated-memory.md` (see
"Adopter configuration" below). It implements the probe contract above for
one `kind`: freshness of a git repository ref.

Its payload, interpreted by the probe -- the envelope itself does not know
its shape:

```yaml
payload:
  repo: .                       # local path or URL `git` understands
  ref: refs/heads/main          # full ref name
  commit: <sha at capture time> # what `ref` resolved to when the anchor
                                 # was captured
```

The live commit is resolved with `git ls-remote <repo> <ref>`, run as a
subprocess without a shell -- uniform for local paths and URLs, and `git` is
a system binary, not a pip dependency, so this keeps the stdlib-only rule.
`git` must be installed and on `PATH`.

The comparison is textual, against the full sha `git ls-remote` returns, so
the capture side must record exactly that: `commit` is the **full 40-hex
sha** the ref resolves to (`git rev-parse <ref>`). Two captures that read
naturally but never match: an abbreviated sha, and -- for an annotated tag --
the peeled commit (`v1^{commit}`), since the ref resolves to the tag
*object*. Both read as a permanent, misleading `drifted`; capture what the
ref resolves to, not what it points at.

- the live commit equals `commit` -- `current`.
- it differs -- `drifted`, with a detail naming the ref and both shas.
- the verdict cannot be determined -- `unknown`, with a detail explaining
  why: `repo`, `ref` or `commit` missing from the payload; a repo that
  cannot be reached; a ref that does not exist (`git ls-remote` exits clean
  with no output); or `git` not installed or not on `PATH`.

Like every probe, it never gates the run over its own verdict, and it holds
itself to the probe contract directly rather than leaning on the
framework's fallback: every failure it can anticipate is caught and turned
into `unknown` with a reason here, so it never raises, never prints a raw
traceback, and never exits non-zero.

## Agent memory

The agent-memory layer is one Markdown file per fact (`memory/*.md`), plus a
one-line-per-entry index at `memory/MEMORY.md`. `lint` enforces five things.

**Frontmatter.** Every memory file's frontmatter carries the shape the Claude
Code harness gives it -- `lint` does not redefine it, only requires it be
complete:

```yaml
name: short-kebab-slug        # required; a non-empty string
description: one-line summary # required; a non-empty string
metadata:
  type: user                  # required; user | project | feedback | reference
```

`name`, `description` or `metadata.type` missing, or `metadata.type` outside
its domain, is an ERROR. Additional keys the harness may add are tolerated
without being checked. A `name` must be unique across the memory set: a
duplicate is an ERROR, since wikilinks resolve by `name` and a duplicate
makes that resolution ambiguous.

**Identity.** A memory's canonical identity is its **filename** without
`.md`. `name` is the identifier wikilinks resolve against, and it gives way
to the filename when the two disagree: the repair is to rewrite `name`, never
to rename the file. The reason is measured rather than aesthetic -- in the
corpus behind ADR 0001, a third of the `name` values were titles carrying
spaces, dots and capitals, for which no rename exists at all.

`lint` reports a divergence against the file, naming both sides and the
direction of the repair:

```
WARNING: memory/coffee-preference.md: name: 'Coffee Preference' does not match
the filename 'coffee-preference'; the filename is the canonical identity --
repair 'name' to match it
```

**This is a WARNING purely as a migration concession**, so that a project
whose memory was written before the rule can adopt the plugin without being
gated on its whole backlog. It is not the norm: the rule is that they match,
and the finding **becomes an ERROR in 2.0.0**. The memory layer carries no
version of its own, so it versions with the plugin. A memory whose `name` is
missing or empty is not also reported as diverging -- that defect already has
its own ERROR, and reporting it twice would say the same thing in two places.

Resolution itself is unchanged: still by `name`. What ADR 0001 settles is
only which of the two fields gives way when they disagree -- see
`docs/adr/0001-filename-is-the-canonical-memory-identity.md`.

**Index.** `MEMORY.md`, at the root of the memory directory, lists one entry
per fact as a Markdown bullet with a link to the file, relative to the
directory:

```markdown
- [Coffee preference](coffee-preference.md) — oat milk in coffee
```

Only bullet lines shaped `- [Title](file.md)` count as entries; headers and
prose are ignored. The index and the memory files must agree in both
directions: an entry whose file does not exist, and a memory file with no
entry in the index, are each an ERROR. A missing `MEMORY.md` stops the run,
pointing at `validated-memory init`.

**Wikilinks.** A `[[name]]` reference in `description` or in a file's body
names another memory by its `name`. A wikilink whose target does not exist is
a WARNING -- it marks something pending to write, and does not gate.

When the target does not resolve but a file **of that name** exists, the
warning names that instead, because "pending to write" would point at the
wrong repair -- the memory is right there, and what does not resolve is its
`name`:

```
WARNING: memory/notes.md: body: wikilink to 'coffee-preference' has no
matching memory; 'coffee-preference.md' declares name 'Coffee Preference'
```

This is the ordinary consequence of a divergence, since people writing
wikilinks reach for the filename. The cause is named only when it is certain:
if two memories in different subdirectories share a filename, either could be
meant, so the generic warning stands rather than guess one.

**Supersession.** A memory is marked superseded by rewriting its
`description` to start with the literal prefix `superseded by ` followed by a
wikilink, e.g. `superseded by [[coffee-preference]]`. Well formed -- the
wikilink resolves to a different memory that exists -- it is recognized and
raises no finding. Malformed is an ERROR: the prefix with no parseable
wikilink after it, a wikilink pointing at a memory that does not exist, or a
wikilink pointing at the memory itself.

## Base contract

Every curated-knowledge unit is a Markdown file whose frontmatter carries:

```yaml
id: <stable-unique-id>          # required; letters, digits, '.', '_', '-'
evidence: measured              # required; measured | verifiable | hypothesis
supersedes: []                  # optional; ids this unit supersedes (many-to-one)
anchors:                        # optional; without anchors a unit cannot expire
  - system: <system-name>       # complete envelope: all four fields required
    kind: git_ref               # probe discriminator; no whitespace
    captured_at: 2026-08-11T10:00:00Z   # ISO-8601 date or timestamp
    payload: {}                 # mapping; interpreted by the probe, not here
provenance: []                  # optional; where the native artifact lives
```

The three evidence states say how a claim is backed, and never mix planes:

- **`measured`** -- directly observed or computed by executing something,
  with a way to re-check it.
- **`verifiable`** -- not directly measured, but checkable without executing,
  by someone who follows the provenance.
- **`hypothesis`** -- a claim not yet checked. A unit is never promoted out
  of it by conviction: promotion is a new unit with better evidence that
  supersedes this one.

An unknown top-level field is an ERROR: adopter-specific fields belong to a
declared extension. A unit with no anchors is a WARNING, not an ERROR.

An `id` must be unique and stable. `validate` enforces form and uniqueness
across the validated set; stability is a convention no single run can check,
since nothing records what the id was before. Reuse of an id across time is
caught by supersession, not by the validator: correct a unit by writing a new
one that supersedes it, never by editing its id.

## Adopter configuration

The adopter's configuration is a file named `validated-memory.md`, read from
the working directory. This version declares three fields, each optional:

```yaml
extension:                         # the declared extension (next section)
  schema: knowledge-extension.md
  version: "1"
id_prefix: kb-                     # the id scheme the adopter's units follow
probes:                            # probe registry: kind -> command
  git_ref: run-git-ref-probe
```

`id_prefix` records the id scheme for humans and skills; `validate` does not
enforce it. `probes` maps an anchor `kind` to the command that probes it (the
`probe` subcommand consumes it). An unknown configuration field, an empty
`id_prefix`, or a probe entry whose command is not a non-empty string each
stop every run with an ERROR naming the configuration file: the configuration
is one document, and a malformed key gates even the subcommands that do not
consume it.

## Declared extension

An adopter extends the contract without forking it. The `extension` block of
the configuration names a versioned schema:

```yaml
extension:
  schema: knowledge-extension.md   # path, relative to the configuration file
  version: "1"                     # the schema version this project is on
```

The schema declares the fields the adopter's units may carry:

```yaml
fields:
  - name: domain
    type: enum                     # closed domain: 'values' is required
    values:
      - network
      - storage
  - name: owner
    type: string                   # any non-empty scalar
```

A declared field carrying a valid value passes. A value outside a closed
domain, and a field neither the base contract nor the schema declares, are
ERRORs naming the unit and the field. A declared field is permitted, not
required: v1 has no way to demand one.

Keep the schema outside the curated-knowledge directory. Anything ending in
`.md` under `knowledge/` is read as a unit, and a schema is not one.

With no configuration file, or with one that declares no `extension` block,
only the base contract applies. With an extension declared, loading is
fail-loud: an unreadable or malformed configuration, a schema that does not
exist, an unknown field type, an enum with no values, a field that redeclares a
base contract field -- each stops the run with an ERROR against the offending
document. Nothing here degrades to base-contract-only validation, because an
extension ignored in silence validates nothing while appearing to pass.

### Versioning the schema

`version` records which schema version the project is on. Adding a field, or
adding a value to a closed domain, is additive and does not bump it. Removing
or narrowing anything does. Units already written are never rewritten to match
a newer schema: correct a unit by writing a new one that supersedes it.

### Frontmatter subset

The frontmatter parser is not a YAML parser. It accepts block mappings, block
lists, nested blocks, empty inline collections (`[]`, `{}`) and plain or quoted
scalars. Everything else -- tabs, block scalars (`|`, `>`), anchors and aliases,
non-empty inline collections, duplicate keys, a key with no value -- is an
ERROR. Scalars are always strings; no type is inferred. A unit whose
frontmatter fails to parse is never validated on a best-effort basis: the parse
error is the only finding reported for it.

## Skills

Five skills, under `skills/*/SKILL.md`, make the method invocable from an
agent session using only the CLI surface documented above -- each names the
exact `validated-memory` invocation to run and the data discipline to
follow, never reimplementing a rule the CLI already enforces:

- **`adopt-validated-memory`** -- bootstrap a project (`init`), wire
  `--harness-memory`, verify the result with `validate` and `lint`.
- **`create-knowledge-unit`** -- write a new curated-knowledge unit, base
  contract field by field, with the evidence-state discipline (never
  promote by conviction; anchors are probeable, provenance is not).
- **`supersede-knowledge`** -- correct existing knowledge with a new unit
  and `supersedes`, never by editing or deleting the superseded one.
- **`probe-freshness`** -- run `probe`, then `derive`, and read the ternary
  verdict in `knowledge-index.md`.
- **`maintain-agent-memory`** -- record or supersede an agent-memory fact,
  and verify the memory set with `lint`.

For the full adoption sequence, see `docs/adoption.md`. For a complete,
reproducible run through every layer -- `init` → create a unit → `validate`
→ `derive` → `probe` → supersede → `derive` again -- see
`docs/walkthrough.md`.

## Startup hook

A `SessionStart` hook (`hooks/hooks.json`, running
`hooks/restore-memory-symlink.sh`) restores a project's `--harness-memory`
symlink automatically on every session start -- the wiring the
`--harness-memory` section above defers to it. It computes the harness's
per-project memory location the same way Claude Code lays out
`~/.claude/projects/` -- one directory per project, keyed by the project's
own path with **every character that is not a letter or a digit** replaced by
`-` -- and re-runs `init --harness-memory` against it, with its stdout
silenced. That rule covers `_` and `.`, not only `/`:
`/home/u/Claude/odoo_ecosystem/odoo_migration` is keyed
`-home-u-Claude-odoo-ecosystem-odoo-migration`. Getting it wrong is the one
failure here that is silent rather than fail-open -- `init` reports success
against a directory the harness never reads, and the memory simply never
shows up -- so the rule is pinned by a test rather than left to the
substitution being "obviously" about slashes.

The hook is fail-open throughout, matching `init`'s own contract: no
`$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, a project that has not adopted validated-memory (no
`validated-memory.md`, or no `memory/`, at its root), no `python3` on
`PATH`, or any other problem along the way is a clean no-op -- it never
gates or breaks session startup, and it never deletes data.

Because the hook runs unattended, it is also where "Absorbing an existing
harness memory directory" (above) normally happens: the first session after a
project adopts the plugin merges the harness's pre-existing memory into the
project and parks the original as a `.bak`. That merge is deliberately part
of `init` rather than a flag the hook passes, so it happens once, by itself,
on the deployment path -- gated by the recognition rule, which is what keeps
it from touching anything that is not agent memory. See `docs/adoption.md`
("The startup hook") for the adopter-facing summary.

## Development

Runtime code is Python 3, standard library only. pytest is the only
development dependency.

```
python3 -m pytest
```

Tests are end-to-end only: they invoke the CLI as a subprocess over fixture
adopter trees and assert on exit codes, output, and produced files. Tests never
import the package's internals.
