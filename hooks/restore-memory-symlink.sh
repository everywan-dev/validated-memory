# restore-memory-symlink.sh -- SessionStart hook for the validated-memory plugin.
#
# Restores the harness's move-proof `--harness-memory` symlink for whatever
# project the harness just opened, so an adopter never has to re-run
# `validated-memory init --harness-memory` by hand after a rename, a
# re-clone, or simply a new session. See the README's "`--harness-memory
# PATH`" section (under `init`) and docs/adoption.md ("The startup hook")
# for the full contract this delegates to.
#
# Fail-open, unconditionally: every branch below either does nothing or
# calls `init`, which is itself idempotent and never destroys data (see
# validated_memory/init.py). Nothing in this script ever deletes a file,
# and the script always exits 0 -- a SessionStart hook must never be able
# to break session startup, whatever it finds.
#
# One thing `init` does do on this path is merge: if the harness memory
# location computed below already holds the harness's own agent memory,
# `init` absorbs it into the project, parks the original as a '.bak' and
# then links (see validated_memory/adopt.py, and the README's "Absorbing an
# existing harness memory directory"). That is deliberate and happens here,
# unattended, on the first session after a project adopts the plugin -- it
# still deletes nothing, and it still exits 0 either way.
#
# What "adopted" means here: the project directory the harness just opened
# (`$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`) has both `validated-memory.md` and `memory/` at
# its root. Anything else -- not adopted yet, only half-scaffolded, or no
# project directory at all -- is a clean no-op.
#
# Harness memory location: this mirrors the per-project layout Claude Code
# itself uses under `~/.claude/projects/` -- one directory per project, named
# after the project's own path with every character that is not a letter or a
# digit replaced by '-'. That covers '_' and '.', not just '/': a project at
# `/home/u/Claude/odoo_ecosystem/odoo_migration` lands under
# `-home-u-Claude-odoo-ecosystem-odoo-migration`, and `/home/u/.ssh` under
# `-home-u--ssh`. Getting this wrong fails silently -- `init` reports success
# against a directory the harness never reads -- so it is pinned by a test.
